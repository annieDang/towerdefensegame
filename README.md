Simple tower defence game that uses the Gosu Ruby library.

# Running

You'll need the gosu gem:
\$ gem install gosu

Then run the main file:
\$ruby start.rb

# Setting

All game assets and setting can be modified at settings.json
I haven't done a good job at game balancing, hopefully you can help me with it :)
